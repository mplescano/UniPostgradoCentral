  <p class="lead">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="lead">There are many articles about doing Splash
    Screens in Java. Not all of them take performance seriously. This one
      does.</p>
  <p class="semilead">A splash screen is an image being shown on  screen while
    an application is starting up. This
      article discusses how to create a splash screen
          that is shown <em>very</em> early
            in the process of starting a Java
            application. To achieve this we minimize the number of API classes
          needed to display the splash screen and we carefully avoid resource
          contention
          by the threads
          running in the JVM. </p>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="problem"></a>1. The Problem</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Java applications often have very long initialization
    times. I am assuming, that we have already tried our best to reduce the start
    up latency of our application. But sometimes we reach a hard limit that we
    cannot undercut. It takes a while until our application is ready, and there
  is nothing we can do about it.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> A splash screen is a means to provide feedback to
    the user, telling that our application is starting up, and it also is a way
  to advertise our product.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> At first glance, implementing a splash screen seems
    to be straightforward. The
    Swing API provides a rich set of classes to do this. Simply create a JWindow,
    put a JLabel with an ImageIcon on it, put the current Thread to
  sleep for 3 seconds and then continue loading the application...</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">    Unfortunately with such a naïve approach
    we not only end up increasing the start up latency of our application by
    the 3 seconds sleep time, we also
    happen to 'achieve' that our splash screen shows up late in the initialization
    process of our application. And if the splash screen shows up late, it does
  not fulfil its job.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">When we design a splash screen we have to take account
    of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="semiparagraph"> <strong>Class resolution.</strong> Before the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can use a class,
          it has to load and initialize all other classes that are referenced by
    this class. Without special measures taken, the JVM loads and initializes all
          application classes before it starts to execute our splash screen code.
    This
    may take up a considerable amount of time.</li>
    <li class="semiparagraph"> 
      <strong>Size of API's.</strong> Displaying "Hello World" using Swing involves
        the loading of roughly 800 API classes into the JVM. Doing the same using
        AWT
          only takes about 600 API classes. The less API classes we use for our
    splash screen, the shorter will be its start up latency.</li>
    <li class="semiparagraph"> <strong>Limited  Resources.</strong> Displaying
      a splash screen is a CPU intensive task. We do not want the application
      initialization code to contend with the splash
      screen
      code
    over CPU resources.</li>
    <li class="semiparagraph">      <strong>Clean design.</strong> We want to
      keep the splash screen code separate from the initialisation code of our
      application. This enables
      us to test it separately,
      and to add
            or remove it to our liking without having to do much code changing.   </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="design"></a>2. Design Proposal</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> The proposed design consists of three classes:
    MyApplication, Splasher and SplashWindow. The diagram below outlines the
    classes and their collaboration.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"><img src="javasplash_files/splashclasses.png" height="108" width="454"></p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">MyApplication is our application class. SplashWindow
    contains all code required to do the fast splash screen. Class Splasher is
    the new entry point for MyApplication. The numbers indicate the sequence
    of method invocations.</p>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="MyApplication"></a>3. Class MyApplication</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph">MyApplication is our application class. It contains
    the long running initialisation code. To achieve a clear design, we keep
    this class free from our splash screen code. The only concession that we
    require is, that its main method must return once the application is up and
  running.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> Here is an outline of the code of MyApplication.java.</p>
  <table class="semiparagraph" bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" width="460">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td class="listing" height="23" valign="top"><p><strong>public class</strong> MyApplication
          {<br>
          <strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void</strong> main(String[] args) {<br>
          <font color="#333333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* Start the application
          and return when it is ready to use. */<br>
          </font></p>
        <p><font color="#333333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//...program code creating
            a JFrame with a &#8216;Hello
            World&#8217; message

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
  }</p></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table><p class="semiparagraph"></p>
  <p>Please note that we can launch the application <em>without</em> a splash
    screen by directly invoking the main method of this class. This is useful
    for testing
  and debugging.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> Now let's see how to add a splash screen to this class. </p>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="Splasher"></a>4. Class Splasher</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Splasher is our bootstrap class. Its  purpose
    is to separate the splash screen code from the application class code, and
    to keep class SplashWindow maintenance free. Class Splasher consists of a
    main method only, which does three things:</p>
  <ol class="semiparagraph">
    <li>    Open the splash window</li>
    <li>	Invoke the main method of class MyApplication</li>
    <li> Close the splash window when the main method of MyApplication returns</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="semiparagraph">    Please note that we want to keep this class as
    small as possible. The size of this class and of the of classes
    referenced by this class directly
        influence
    the startup latency of our splash screen.</p>
  <table class="semiparagraph" bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" width="460">
    <tbody><tr>
      <td class="listing" height="23" valign="top"><p><strong>public class</strong> Splasher
          {<br>
          <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void main</strong>(String[] args) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SplashWindow.splash(Splasher.class.getResource("splash.gif"));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SplashWindow.invokeMain("MyApplication", args);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SplashWindow.disposeSplash();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
}</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>
  <p class="semiparagraph">As you can see, this class consists only of code that
    delegates tasks to the SplashWindow class.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">In fact, we could have moved all
    the code of this class into class SplashWindow. Why haven't I done so? Class
        Splasher contains all the code that needs to be changed per application.
        That is, for each application we will be using another splash image,
    and the class name of the application will also be different. This keeps
    class
      SplashWindow free from application specific changes. It can be reused over
    and over again, without ever having to touch its code.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Also note, that we could have put all three method
      calls
      into a single call. But keeping each step of the initialization procedure
    separate, makes the procedure easier to understand.</p>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="SplashWindow"></a>5. Class SplashWindow</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Now lets take a look at class SplashWindow. This
    class and its interaction with the other two classes are the meat of this
  article. </p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">I will show only the essential portions of this
  class, the full listing is available in the attachment.</p>
  <h3 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="invokeMain"></a>5.1 Method invokeMain()</h3>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> First lets take a look at method invokeMain(). Here
    we invoke the main() method of our application using, er, clumsy Reflection
    code.</p>
  <table class="semiparagraph" bgcolor="#f0f0f0" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" width="460">

  <p class="semiparagraph">    Today, most Java VM's lazily resolve and verify
    classes. At one time, on Mac OS X 10.1, we had the case of an eagerly resolving
    Java VM. Without using
    Reflection,
the main method of class Splasher was only executed, after the Java VM had resolved
all dependencies between the Splasher class and the rest of the application,
including of all API's used by the application.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> Reflection is a means to dynamically write code at
    runtime. Therefore, the dependency between our splash screen code and the
    application code will only be revealed
  to the Java VM, when the Class.forName() method is executed. Since class Splasher
  invokes method invokeMain() after it has invoked method splash(), the splash
  screen will be shown to the user, before such a resolution process can take
  place.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> Reflection does not prevent though, that the Java
    VM loads all files of a JAR file and of dependent JAR files into memory
    before executing our code. If
    JAR file loading is a restricting performance factor (e.g. because we load
    them over
    a slow network connection), we may want to put the Splasher class and the
    SplashWindow together with the splash image into a separate JAR file. In
    the manifest of
    the JAR file, we do not specify a dependency to the application JAR files.
    Instead,
    we change the invokeMain() method, to have it use an URLClassLoader to load
    the JAR files containing the application.</p>
  <h3 class="doubleparagraph">5.2 Method splash()</h3>

  <p class="semiparagraph">You may have noticed, that there are two splash methods:
    one that creates the image from the URL, and one that works with the SplashWindow
    instance. This is just because
    I like to keep methods short and simple.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"><a name="firstsplash"></a>In the first splash() method we use  the AWT Toolkit
    class to create the image. We use this method instead of the new Image IO
    API, because it does not immediately load the image using the current thread.
    We will initiate image loading in the AWT Event Dispatcher thread later.
     I will come back to this topic further <a href="#constructor">below</a> in this article.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> <a name="secondsplash" id="secondsplash"></a>In the second splash() method, you see that an instance
    of the SplashWindow is created (class SplashWindow is a subclass of java.awt.Window).
    Then, the instance
      is
      shown. And then, we wait in a synchronized block until the paint method
    of the instance has been called.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">The last two steps are worth looking at closely.
    Showing the SplashWindow, starts the AWT Event Dispatcher thread, which is
    going
    to call
    the paint
    method of the
  SplashWindow.    We wait in the synchronized block until the painting has happened.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Why is there an if-statement which guards the synchronized
    block?</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">We must not wait, if method splash() is called
    from the AWT Event Dispatcher thread. This would cause a live lock, which
    would hang our application. This check appears to be overkill, because we
    are calling this method from the Main thread anyway. I have added it, because
    I sometimes use the SplashWindow
    to display the about
    box of my application, and then I don't want to care on which thread
    I am calling this method.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">The check for the number of available processors is
    more interesting.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">On a single processor machine, if we wouldn't wait
    here, and instead proceed with
      our
      start up
      process,
      we
        would compete for the CPU  with the AWT
        Event Dispatcher thread. Since the AWT Event Dispatcher thread has not
      yet started, we are likely to win the competition, or &#8211; in this case &#8211;
    actually hog the CPU, and therefore significantly delay the splash screen.
    In the
        worst
        case,
      the splash screen would not be shown at all.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">On a multiple processor
      machine, we have a chance, that both threads will get a CPU of their own.
      In this
        case, we have an opportunity to maximize resource usage. Of course, it
      all depends on how independent the two threads are with respect to other
      resources
        they
        are using. Thus, on a multiprocessor machine, we take a small risk of
    delaying the splash screen by a little bit. In return for the risk, we get
     better overall
        performance.</p>

  <p class="semiparagraph">In the <a href="#firstsplash">first</a> of the two splash() methods, we used

    not actually load the image data into memory. We load it now synchronously
    using a MediaTracker.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Depending on the number of available processors, this
    is not the only thing that is going on. This is because, the Main thread
    may (or may not be) waiting in the synchronized block in the <a href="#secondsplash">second</a> of
    the two splash() methods.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">If we are running on a single CPU machine, the
      processing of the image is  the only task that we want to work on
    now. If the image is contained in the same JAR file as the other splash screen
    classes,
    the
      Java VM has loaded it into memory already. All we have to do, is to decode
    the image. The time for this task is entirely CPU bound. Any attempt to work
    on more than one task now, would needlessly
    delay the splash screen.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">On a machine with more processors, the loading will
    happen asynchronously to
      the
      Main thread, which we have sent off to  launch the application. If all

    loading the image and leaving   other resources free for the application

                        drawing an image that completely covers this area, we
      directly call paint(). This is done to avoid undesired flickering of the
      splash image.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph"> In method paint(), we draw the image, and after this
                          has happened the first time, we notify the Main thread
                          of our
                          application.
                          As I have
                          described further <a href="#secondsplash">above</a>,
                          on a single CPU machine, the Main thread is patiently
                          awaiting this notification in method splash(). This
                          strategy
                          ensures
                          that, on a single CPU machine, the
    user is granted
                          to see
    the splash window.</p>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Doing a fast  splash screen, requires that we carefully
    manage resources, so that tasks
    needed for displaying the splash screen are executed prior to other tasks.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">This article has shown, how to use Reflection to shift
    the class resolution task behind the splash screen task,
    and how
    to keep
    the CPU resource(s) focused on the splash screen task, until we have painted
    our splash image on screen.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">In side tracks of this article, we have covered additional
    issues, such as avoiding  flickering, and how to take advantage of multiprocessor
    machines.</p>
  <h2 class="doubleparagraph"><a name="enhancements"></a>Possible enhancements</h2>
  <p class="semiparagraph">    The splash screen described in this article is
    pretty much bare bone. If you like, you can extend it to display information
    about start up steps
  to the user.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">To do this, remember that we have designed class SplashWindow
      using the Singleton design pattern. Thus you can add more static methods
      to class SplashWindow,
          which act on the Singleton instance. These static methods can be accessed
          from the
    main method of the MyApplication class (and of any other methods involved
    in the start up procedure of our application).</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">This will have no negative
      impact
      on the class resolution and class loading issue, because the dependency
    is  directed from the application code to the splash screen code, and not
    the other way round.</p>

  <h3 class="doubledividerparagraph">Related Documentation</h3>
  <p class="semiparagraph"><a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/oop/javasplash/Java%20Splash%20Screen.pdf" target="_blank">Java
  Splash Screen.pdf</a> by Roy Ratcliffe takes a in-depth  look at a number
  of different optimization strategies for fast splash screens. Also discusses
  when to use
  and not to use
  a splash screen.</p>
  <h3 class="doubledividerparagraph">Splash Screen for Applets</h3>
  <p class="semiparagraph">A  technique for presenting a Splash screen
    in an Applet, is to override method paint() of the Applet, and to let method
    init() invoke a Runnable() or a SwingWorker() on a background thread. Once
    the background thread finishes, it adds  components to the Applet which obscure
    the splash screen.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">I am using this technique for Applets which have a
    relatively small download size (less than 200 KB), but need a long time
    to initialize.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">For a working example take a look at my <a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubikplayer/download.html">RubikPlayer
    Applet</a> and my <a href="http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubik/virtualcubes/index.html">VirtualCube
    Applets</a>. Both applets show a copyright message
    during initalisation. The latter take a little bit longer to initialize,
    so you can see the splash screen longer.</p>

  <p class="semiparagraph">I would like to thank Roy Ratcliffe for
    his  valuable critique and  input on both the code and this article.
    And, of course, for providing an excellent analysis of multi-threaded
    splash screens.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">Special thanks go to Harry Mantheakis for the many
    suggestions and the through analysis of the splash screen code published
    in the first version of this
  article.</p>
  <p class="semiparagraph">I would like to thank the Apple Java-Dev community
